    <em><p>Portuguese cataplana is a long-simmered pork stew to which clams are added. For our quick take on the dish, we've replaced the usual pork shoulder with sausage</p>
    </em>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bottled clam juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Pinch dried red-pepper flakes</li>
        <li>16 littleneck clams, scrubbed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper</li>

   </ul>
   <h2>Steps:</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large pot, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add the sausage; cook, turning, until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to moderately low. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds longer. Remove from the heat. Cut the sausage into 1/2-inch slices and stir them and the tomato paste into the pot.</li>
    <li>In a medium stainless-steel saucepan, combine the clam juice, wine, bay leaves, and red-pepper flakes. Discard any clams that are broken or do not clamp shut when tapped. Add the clams to the pan. Cover and bring to a boil. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams open, about 3 minutes. Remove the open clams and continue to cook, uncovering the pan as necessary to remove the clams as soon as they open. Discard any that do not open.</li>
    <li>Carefully pour the clam-cooking liquid into the sausage mixture, leaving any grit in the bottom of the pan. Add 2 tablespoons of the parsley, salt if needed, and the black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and continue simmering for 5 minutes. Stir in the clams in their shells. Simmer, covered, just until the clams are warm through, about 1 minute. Serve topped with the remaining parsley.</li>
   </ol>
