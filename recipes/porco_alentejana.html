    <em><p>This simple braise is a mainstay along the coast of Portugal. With clams from the sea and pork from the nearby mountains, it speaks to the landscape, and diet, of Portugal itself.</p>
    <p>Its garlicky broth pairs well with crusty bread and dry Portuguese wine. </p></em>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <ul>
    <li>2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves, divided</li>
    <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Pimentón de la Vera dulce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 medium-size (9-ounce) yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and crushed by hand</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken stock or lower-sodium chicken broth, divided</li>
    <li>2 pounds baby Yukon Gold potatoes, halved</li>
    <li>2 pounds Manila clams or cockles, scrubbed</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges and crusty bread, for serving</li>

   </ul>
   <h2>Steps:</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Season pork all over with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and place in a large ziplock plastic bag. Smash 3 garlic cloves, and add to bag with wine, bay leaves, and Pimentón. Seal and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove pork from marinade, and pat dry. Remove and discard garlic and bay leaves; reserve remaining marinade. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Add half of pork, and cook, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate. Repeat with remaining half of pork. Chop remaining 3 garlic cloves, and add to Dutch oven with onion and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil; cook, stirring often, until golden, about 6 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, red pepper, and reserved marinade</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring often, 3 minutes. Return cooked pork to Dutch oven; stir in 1 cup stock until pork is mostly submerged. Cover and bake in preheated oven until pork is fork-tender, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Stir in potatoes and remaining 1 cup stock. Cover and bake until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer Dutch oven to stovetop over high, and add clams. Cover and cook until clams open, 3 to 5 minutes. (Remove and discard any unopened clams.) Season with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with lemon wedges and crusty bread.</li>
   </ol>
